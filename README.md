## Credits
What we are doing here is mostly collecting useful snippets from all over the interwebs (for example, a good chunk is from [Apache Server Configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache)) into one place. While weâ€™ve been trying to credit where due, things might be missing. If you believe anything here is your work and credits should be given, let us know, or just send a PR.
